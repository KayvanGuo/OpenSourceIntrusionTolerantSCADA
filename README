About:

The purpose of this project is to develop a proof of concept system for 
survivable SCADA via intrusion-tolerant replication.  Our implementation will
use the Prime Replication System (http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/byzrep/prime.html) to 
provide performance and safety guarantees over space and time for the SCADA 
master.  It will also use a modified version of PVBrowser 
(http://pvbrowser.de/pvbrowser/index.php) for the Human-Machine Interface (HMI).

There is a paper outlining this concept, available from JHU DSN:
http://www.cnds.jhu.edu/pub/papers/Survivable_SCADA.pdf

This project is being completed as part of the Advanced Distributed 
Systems course at the Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of 
Prof. Yair Amir and the Johns Hopkins Distribued Systems & Networks Lab.

The work has completed. See the powerpoint at
http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/courses/cs667-2015/SCADA/
for details of our project.

Folders:
it_scada_modbus is the folder where the final code for the demo is. This
is the demo that is of a real SCADA system and uses replication.

modbus_sockets is a demo of pvbrowser without the shared memory

modbus_tcp_sim is an RTU simulator we built to generate dummy values.
it has been deprecated, and replaced with a physical RTU emulator

scada_modbus is a demo of pvbrowser without the shared memory of a real
SCADA system without replication
