About:

The purpose of this project is to develop a proof of concept system for 
survivable SCADA via intrusion-tolerant replication.  Our implementation will
use the Prime Replication System (http://www.dsn.jhu.edu/byzrep/prime.html) to 
provide performance and safety guarantees over space and time for the SCADA 
master.  It will also use a modified version of PVBrowser 
(http://pvbrowser.de/pvbrowser/index.php) for the Human-Machine Interface (HMI).

There is a paper outlining this concept, available from JHU DSN:

This project project is being completed as part of the Advanced Distributed 
Systems course at the Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of 
Prof. Yair Amir and the Johns Hopkins Distribued Systems & Networks Lab.
